Using this repo as an easy way to share a literature review assignment as part of coursework done in my CS447 Natural Language Processing class as part UIUC's MCS program. The topic of this review is on Emotion or Mental State Recognition in Utterances in Texts using Natural Language Processing Methods where we selected our own topic, searched and selected 4 papers primarily on ACL Anthology, read and reviewed them in relation to the mentioned topic and questions relevant to it.
